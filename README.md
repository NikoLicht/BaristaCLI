# BaristaCLI
A little quirky terminal coffee adventure game. In this game you use actions on objects in order to achieve that delicious virtual brew. Have fun and play around.

# How to run?

You can run the (probably) outdated .exe file in the executables folder

For the lazy: [BaristaCLI.exe](https://github.com/NikoLicht/BaristaCLI/blob/main/Executables/BaristaCLI_v_01.exe)

Alternatively, you can run it like this
```sh
git clone https://github.com/NikoLicht/BaristaCLI.git
cd BaristaCLI
python -m venv venv
Windows: venv\scripts\activate OR Mac / Linux: source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python barista.py

deactivate (to exit your virtual evnironment)
```
